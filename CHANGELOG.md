## [Unreleased]

First release.

### Added

- Geometry helpers create features and return MPh nodes: `geometry`,
  `block`, `cylinder`, `sphere`, `point`, `workplane`, `square`,
  `rectangle`, `circle`, `polygon`, `line_segment`, `interval`, `extrude`,
  `revolve` and `import_`, and `feature` creates any other geometry
  feature. `component_of` returns the component a geometry belongs to.
- Operations combine and transform objects: `union`, `difference`,
  `intersection`, `delete`, `partition`, `fillet`, `chamfer`, `array`,
  `move`, `rotate`, `mirror` and `rigid_transform`.
- `mk.sel` selects entities by location instead of by number, for the
  whole model or inside a geometry sequence or work plane (`where=`):
  `box`, `ball`, `cylinder`, `disk`, `all`, `union`, `intersection`,
  `difference`, `complement`, `adjacent`, `result`, `layer` and
  `cumulative`.
- `sel.entities`, `sel.find`, `measure` and `bounding_box` query the
  geometry and leave nothing in the model.
- `coordinate_system` creates coordinate systems such as perfectly matched
  layers, and `set` sets properties of any node or Java object.
- `LicenseError` is raised when a feature needs a license that is not
  available.
